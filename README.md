# geojson_to_osm
GeoJSON to OSM Flask powered UI for ogr2osm.

Uses [pnorman ogr2osm](https://github.com/pnorman/ogr2osm) as backend for converting GeoJSON to OSM XML data.

Please note that this is currently in beta as it DOES NOT support semantic tag conversion. You may have to edit the final OSM export to find/replace tag keys by real OSM map features.

CSS style by https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson from the overpass turbo project.
